# How to use NextJs SaaS Basic Boilerplate

## Initial Setup

When you get the boilerplate code from BoilerCode.co, You need to update your own credentials in `env` file.

- Open `.env.example` file, In this file you will find all the variables that you need.
- Create a new file `.env.local`, Copy all the variable from `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update your own credentials.
- We have added the documentation links to each env variable on how you can get those.

- Run `npm install`, this will install all the required dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev`, this will start the server on localhost

## User Auth

In this NextJs boilerplate, we are using NextAuth for handling the user authentication. NextAuth is an Open Source Auth Framework which support Login with Email, Social Login and Login with Magic Link in very easy steps.

**Guide in Boilerplate**

- In our dependency file `package.json` we have

```
"next-auth": "^4.23.1",
```

- Go to `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` file, This is the most important file for NextAuth. It handles the authentication options also this is required for `signin`, `signout` features.

```js
providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
    EmailProvider({
      server: {
        host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
        port: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT,
        auth: {
          user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
          pass: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD,
        },
      },
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
    }),
  ],
```

In above code, you can update the authentication methods.

```js
adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
```

In the same file, we have `PrismaAdapter` which is getting used to store user information in our database.

```js
theme: {
    colorScheme: "auto",
    brandColor: "#FFFFFF",
    logo: "http://localhost:3000/favicon.ico",
    buttonText: "#000000",
  },
```

And you also have options to change themes in your authentication pages.

## Email Integration

We are using `Mailgun` SMTP Server for sending emails. You can use any SMTP server you want for sending emails. You only need to update `SMTP` configs in `.env` file.

**Guide in Boilerplate**

- In `.env.local` file, update your SMTP configurations.
- In `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` file, We are using those STMP configs for sending User Auth emails.
- In `/lib/mailService.js`, You will find boilerplate code for sending custom HTML supported emails.

```js
async sendMail(mailOptions) {
  //you will find code in boilerplate codebase
}

async sendWelcomeEmail(to, name) {
  //you will find code in boilerplate codebase
}
```

## Database Integration

For Database, We are using `Prisma` and `Postgres`. But the best things with `Prisma` is you can switch to any other database without needing to change anything else.

**Guide in Boilerplate**

- `/prisma` dir has a file `schema.prisma` where you can add your database tables.
- In the same file `schema.prisma`, You just need to modify below code to change the database

```js
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```
