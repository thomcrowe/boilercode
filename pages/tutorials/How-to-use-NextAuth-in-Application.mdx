        # How to use NextAuth in Application

In this tutorial, we will walkthrough how to use [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) in your application. NextAuth is an authentication library for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you’ll need the following:

* An understanding of JavaScript
* Familiarity with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* Access to a terminal and a text editor

## Getting Started

First, you’ll need to install the `next-auth` package. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install next-auth
```

Next, you’ll need to create a `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` file. This is where you’ll define the configuration for your authentication.

```js
import { NextAuth } from "next-auth";
import Providers from "next-auth/providers";

const options = {
  site: process.env.SITE || "http://localhost:3000",
  providers: [
    Providers.Google({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
};

export default (req, res) => NextAuth(req, res, options);
```

Now, you’ll need to create a `pages/index.js` file. This is where you’ll define the user interface for your application.

```js
import { useSession } from "next-auth/client";

export default function Home() {
  const [session, loading] = useSession();

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {!loading && !session && (
        <>
          <p>You are not signed in.</p>
          <a href="/api/auth/signin">Sign in</a>
        </>
      )}
      {!loading && session && (
        <>
          <p>You are signed in.</p>
          <a href="/api/auth/signout">Sign out</a>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Finally, you’ll need to start the server. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm run dev
```

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to use NextAuth in your application. You set up the authentication configuration in the `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` file, and you created the user interface in the `pages/index.js` file. You also learned how to start the server.
