This tutorial is for beginners who are looking to learn how to render images in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you should have some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated applications. It provides an easy to use environment for developing, testing, and deploying web applications.

## How to render images in Next.js

In order to render images in Next.js, you can use the built-in `<img>` tag. The `<img>` tag takes two attributes: `src` and `alt`. The `src` attribute should contain the path to the image you want to render, and the `alt` attribute should contain a short description of the image.

```html
<img src="/path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

You can also use the `<Image>` component from the Next.js image library. This component takes the same attributes as the `<img>` tag, but also provides additional features such as lazy loading and image optimization.

```jsx
import { Image } from 'next/image'

<Image src="/path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" />
```

For more information on how to use the `<Image>` component, please refer to the [Next.js Image documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/images).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we discussed how to render images in Next.js. We saw how to use the built-in `<img>` tag, as well as the `<Image>` component from the Next.js image library. With this knowledge, you should be able to easily add images to your Next.js applications.
