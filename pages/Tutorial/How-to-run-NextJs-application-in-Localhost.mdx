Next.js is a JavaScript framework that allows developers to quickly build server-side rendered applications. This tutorial will show you how to run a Next.js application in localhost.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin with this tutorial, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

* Node.js
* NPM/Yarn
* Git

## Step 1: Create a Next.js Application

The first step is to create a new Next.js application. To do this, open up your terminal and run the following command:

```
npx create-next-app
```

This command will create a new Next.js application in the current directory.

## Step 2: Install the Packages

Once the application has been created, you will need to install the necessary packages. To do this, run the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages required for the application.

## Step 3: Start the Server

Once the packages have been installed, you can start the server by running the following command in the terminal:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and you will be able to access your application on http://localhost:3000.

## Conclusion
